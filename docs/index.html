        <h2>GeoCorps is an area of interest group within BayGeo founded in 2017. The Bay Area is home to a vibrant and tenacious social justice activism and advocacy community that works tirelessly to address issues in housing, criminal justice and the environment and it is no coincidence that the people who work every day on these issues in their own communities know them better than anyone else. Rather than co-opt the existing work of others, GeoCorps seeks to support those individuals and organizations when their needs can be met with the maps, databases, graphics and web infrastructure that our members make best. GeoCorps is committed to providing professional, quality labor and expertise to help nonprofits meet their goals on their terms.
By providing cost-free consulting to nonprofits, we can do a good turn for the community that has supported us while giving valuable hands-on experience to geospatial professionals who want to build their portfolios.
